Good morning,everyone! I`m very happy to have this chance to give my presentation. Before I start my speech, please let me ask you a question. Do you think you are confident in yourself? If you are, do please raise your hand.

　　My topic today is “ to Be a Confident Person.”

　　What is confidence? Confidence is to trust yourself. Confidence is to look upon yourself. It is not to indulge in self-admiration. It is not to get extremely arrogant. It is not to get dizzy with success or to be opinionated. It is just to inspire yourself ahead of a quality of mind, in high spirit, full of energy. It is to meet the challenges of life in a positive mood. It is to overcome your inferiority, farewell, to get rid of the trouble of a a ready-made panacea.

　　Remember, I have just entered junior high school. In the face of the challenge of new environment, in the face of so many new courses and learning contents, I lost faith in my own and gradually developed a psychological sense of inferiority. Achievement glided ceaselessly. It is a teacher and mother who encouraged me and let me regain confidence. Gradually, my grades got higher and higher and everything began to go on well. Gradually I adapted to the life in middle school.

　　Friends, let's say goodbye to inferiority. Let’s be a confident person. Because: only if you have self-confidence, can you control yourself; only if you have confidence, can you achieve success and create your a brilliant life of your own!
